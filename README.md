# Rumbl

This repository is for the "Rumbl" project
built while following
Programming Phoenix 1.4:
https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4

Unless you are following the book,
this is unlikely to make much sense to you.

If you _are_ following the book,
this repo should be a good reference for the code changes made along the way.


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
